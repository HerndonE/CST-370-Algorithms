0. hw0_1 - This program reads the user's input data and conducts sum and difference     
operations, depending on the command key.    

	To run hw0_1
```console
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw0/hw0_1 $ g++ -o hw0_1 hw0_1.cpp
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw0/hw0_1 $ bash test_script_hw0_1.sh
```

1. hw1_1 - A program that that reads input numbers from a user and displays the closest
distance between two numbers among all input numbers.

	To run hw1_1
```console
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw1/hw1_1 $ g++ -o hw1_1 hw1_1.cpp
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw1/hw1_1 $ bash test_script_hw1_1.sh
```

2. hw1_2 - A program that reads two groups of numbers in which each group has random integer numbers with
possible duplicates. 

	To run hw1_2
```console
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw1/hw1_2 $ g++ -o hw1_2 hw1_2.cpp
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw1/hw1_2 $ bash test_script_hw1_2.sh
```

3. hw2_1 -  A program checks if two strings are anagram or not.     

	To run hw2_1
```console
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw2/hw2_1 $ g++ -o hw2_1 hw2_1.cpp
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw2/hw2_1 $ bash test_script_hw2_1.sh
```

4. hw2_2 - A program that reads two timestamps of two events from a user and displays the difference between the two timestamps.    

	To run hw2_2
```console
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw2/hw2_2 $ g++ -o hw2_2 hw2_2.cpp
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw2/hw2_2 $ bash test_script_hw2_2.sh
```

5. hw3_1 - A program that reads a set of events and displays the maximum number of events that take place concurrently.    

	To run hw3_1
```console
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw3/hw3_1 $ g++ -o hw3_1 hw3_1.cpp
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw3/hw3_1 $ bash test_script_hw3_1.sh
```

6. hw3_2 - A program that converts a directed graph data from a user into a corresponding adjacency list format.     

	To run hw3_2
```console
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw3/hw3_2 $ g++ -o hw3_2 hw3_2.cpp

```

7. hw4_1 - A program that reads a number of elements in a set and then the elements     
of the set. Then it displays all possible binary numbers and corresponding subsets one by one.          

	To run hw4_1
```console
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw4/hw4_1 $ g++ -o hw4_1 hw4_1.cpp
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw4/hw4_1 $ bash test_script_hw4_1.sh
```

8. hw4_2 - A program that that collects the maximum number of apples in boxes.    

	To run hw4_2
```console
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw4/hw4_2 $ g++ -o hw4_2 hw4_2.cpp
vocstartsoft:~/environment/hw4/hw4_2 $ bash test_script_hw4_2.sh
